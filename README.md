#Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in code files during software development.

1. **Repository (Repo)**:
   - A repository is a storage location where Git tracks changes to files, preserving their versions and history. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (hosted on a server like GitHub).

2. **Commit**:
   - A commit represents a specific version of the repository at a given point in time. It records changes made to files, accompanied by a commit message describing the modifications.

3. **Branch**:
   - A branch is a separate line of development within a repository. It allows developers to work on features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged later.

4. **Merge**:
   - Merging combines changes from different branches. Git automatically merges changes when possible, but conflicts might arise when changes conflict, requiring manual resolution.

5. **Pull Request (PR)**:
   - A pull request is a feature in Git-based platforms (like GitHub) allowing developers to propose changes from their branch to be reviewed and merged into another branch.

6. **Remote**:
   - A remote refers to a shared repository stored on a server (like GitHub). It enables collaboration among multiple developers by providing a centralized location for the project.

7. **Clone**:
   - Cloning is the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository. It establishes a connection between the local copy and the remote, allowing developers to work on the code locally.

8. **Fetch**:
   - Fetching retrieves changes from a remote repository to the local repository without merging them. It updates the local reference to the remote branches.

9. **Pull**:
   - Pulling updates the local repository with changes from a remote repository. It's a combination of `fetch` (to retrieve changes) and `merge` (to incorporate changes into the current branch).

10. **Push**:
    - Pushing sends local commits to a remote repository, updating the remote branch with the changes made locally.

11. **Conflict**:
    - A conflict occurs when Git can't automatically merge changes from different branches due to overlapping edits. Developers must resolve conflicts manually.
